This demonstrates a problem with the executable jar which is generated by the spring-boot-maven-plugin.
It uses com.github.robtimus:ftp-fs for registering a `FileSystemProvider`. When executed via intellij, 
providers for schemes `ftp` and `ftps` are registered and the `FileSystem` gets created.
When executed as jar file via `java -jar target/fsibug-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` it fails with
`java.nio.file.ProviderNotFoundException: Provider "ftp" not found`.
